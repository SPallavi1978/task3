  Java[a] is one of the Greater Sunda Islands in Indonesia. It is bordered by
  the Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea (a part of Pacific Ocean) to
  the north. With a population of 156.9 million people (including Madura) in mid
  2024, projected to rise to 158 million at mid 2025, Java is the world's most
  populous island, home to approximately 55.7% of the Indonesian population
  (only approximately 44.3% of Indonesian population live outside Java).[2]
  Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta, is on Java's northwestern coast. Many of
  the best known events in Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the
  centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the
  core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the
  Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java
  dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. Four of
  Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon
  National Park, Borobudur Temple, Prambanan Temple, and Sangiran Early Man
  Site.
